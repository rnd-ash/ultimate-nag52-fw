## DISCLAIMER

I am in no way responsible if your gearbox or car dies as a result of using this firmware!
Although this firmware is being tested actively, there are loads of unknowns which may occur rarely during operation that
are not tested yet.

## IMPORTANT

If you have just built your board, or are updating to firmware after 30/11/22, please look at [this guide](https://youtu.be/ov3pYcKIA70)!
Your TCU will be bricked until you follow it!
