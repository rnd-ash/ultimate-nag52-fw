# IMPORTANT - 19/10/23 and newer FW
This firmware contains initial EGS52 calibration data. You will need to select the correct settings for your car in the configuration app under
`TCU Program settings -> CAL`
You can see [here](https://docs.ultimate-nag52.net/en/gettingstarted/configuration/calibration) for an explination on calibration settings

# Dev (Unreleased)

# 13/06/24
* Improve the stability of the TCU when in emergency mode (No configuration)

# 05/06/24

## Bugs
* Adaptation is disabled at this time due to the massive rework, it will be re-enabled in a future release.

## Added
* Update ESP-IDF to 5.1.1
* Fix for keyless GO systems starting
* **Add support for EGS52 calibration data**
    * Uses OEM EGS hydraulic configuration data
    * Uses OEM EGS clutch calibration data
        * Friction coefficient table
        * Spring pressure table
    * Uses OEM EGS torque converter calibration data
        * Torque multiplication map
        * Pump torque map
* Add reverse-engineered EGS52 pressure control algorithm!
    * Computes working and solenoid inlet pressure
    * Corrects output MPC and SPC pressure accordingly
    * Computes clutch friction coeffients for optimal MPC working pressure (This means MPC working map no longer exists)
* Add in prefill for off clutch when changing gears (**NO MORE 3-4 FLARE!**)
* Clean process on first boot after update
* Add option for TCU_ADV_SETTINGS to disable torque requests for each gear change
* Sensor API rework
    * Poll all sensors on a 20ms timer tick
    * Average out VBATT and TFT signals in order to get a more steady reading
    * Speed sensors are averaged over 8 reading polls (160ms) for a much cleaner reading
* Brand new Solenoid API
    * On/Off solenoid - On for specific period of time, then activate holding phase
    * Inrush solenoid - On, Hold, Off for specific period (Torque converter solenoid)
    * CC Solenoid - Constant current driver solenoid (Corrected every 2ms)
* New torque converter (v3) algorithm
    * Adaptation maps are now present for slip and locking
    * Take into account energy through the turbine (Joules)
    * Only adapt when slip and user pedal input are stable
* New shifter input logic
    * Split the 3 style shifters into their own classes (EWM, TRRS, SLR)
    * SLR - Implement the C/M/S knob for profile selection
    * TRRS - Better handling of range restriction input
* Make output shaft sensor appear in config app if present
* DIAG `FN_SALVE_MODE` emulation (Originally on EGS52) - Allows for controlling IO of the TCU on a test bench via CAN
* DIAG `FN_CANLOGGER_MODE` - Allows for sniffing CANBUS on a vehicle (TCU does not send frames in this mode)
* EGS51 CAN Layer - Changes
    1. Read `VB` (Fuel flow) signal (Recorded in config app for parity with EGS52/53)
    2. Read `KUEB_S_A` and `KUEB_O_A` (Engine torque converter state request) bits, and pass them to torque converter control code
    3. Send `K_O_B`, `K_G_B` and `K_S_B` signals (Torque converter clutch state)
    4. Send `NEUTRAL` bit when in P/N.
    5. Send `GARAGE_SHIFT` bit when shifting from P->R or N->D (Gearbox protection under garage shifting)
* EGS52 CAN Layer - Changes
    1. Set the `HSM` (Manual mode) bit when using a profile that shifts manually (Used by ESP and Engine ECU)
    2. Send `FMRAD` (Input -> Output torque multiplier) signal (For Cruise control and ESP)
    3. Send `M_VERL` - Torque converter loss
    4. Send `K_O_B`, `K_G_B` and `K_S_B` signals (Torque converter clutch state)
    5. Read `KUEB_S_A` and `KUEB_O_A` (Engine torque converter state request) bits, and pass them to torque converter control code
* Torque requests - Add `BackToDriverDemand` torque request bit (EGS52/53). This allows the engine to know that torque will be increasing and it can roll back the ignition retarding (Results in a much smoother up ramp)
* Rework IO Expander and program selector API (Credit: @chrissivo)
* Add support for the SLR McLaren shifter!
* Add in CUSTOM_CAN CAN layer. This is to support 3rd party engine ECUs [See here for more information](https://docs.ultimate-nag52.net/en/advanced/custom-can)
* Shift logic rewrite (This is why adaptation is disabled)
    * Overlap is now split into 2 phases (Release phase, Apply and hold phase)
    * Filling of the clutches is now performed in 3 stages (High, Ramp, Low)
    * Add in engine Inertia compensation when shifting to pull the engine to the correct RPM

# 21/08/23
* EGS51 - Repair wonky torque requests
* Shift reporter - Remove warning about invalid report on flash - Since shift reporter is not being used - we can ignore it.

# 08/08/23

## Added
* EGS53 - Add support for shift paddles
* EEPROM Module settings interface
    * Allows for hot-modifying variables in the TCUs code base!
    * Wiki integration in the configuration app

    * Calculate the speed of the engaging and releasing clutch during the gear changes
    * Allow the TCU to dynamically set the SPC ramp based on clutch progress to target speed
    * Add RLIs so you can monitor this in the config app

* TRRS Range-restrict mode!
* HFM CAN (WIP)
* Remove the MPC filler adder map
* Make MPC prefill pressure += SPC prefill pressure for better prefill quality
* TCC opens up during shifting, like stock EGS to dampen the gear change for a smoother change - This will be configurable in a later update.
* Finally, smoother N-D gear engagement, however **Shifting into N-R is STILL rough**
* EGS53 - Fixed display showing 1st when in 5th gear
* Modified Input speed calculation algorithm to not use a fixed multiplier when in 1st or 5th
* Add settings to configure push button on shifter / TRRS

# 10/04/23

### Added

* Smooth TCC bite and apply algorithm for smoother applying
* Fixed bump after shifting caused by TCC re-applying
* Improved PCNT based RPM reading

### Fixed
* Fixed downshift maps not being used correctly by the TCU
